## Bug fixes

These are a great place to start contributing to the repo!

Once you start work on a bug, post your intent on the issue itself. This will prevent more than one person working on it at once.

If the bug you want to work on doesn't have a related issue, open one, and attach the "Bug" label.

## New features

If you want to add some enhancements over the library, open a [Feature Proposal](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/openapi-rpc-node/issues) issue with "enhancement" label.

This will let us talk through your proposal API and/or implementation before you spend time on it.

## Development

2. Make the desired changes to the library.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation, which lives in [docs folder](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/openapi-rpc-node/tree/main/docs).
5. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.
7. Push the changes to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to the Motion repository.
9. Review and address comments on your pull request.
10. If changes are requested and addressed, please request review to notify reviewers to take another look.
